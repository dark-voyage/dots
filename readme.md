## About

In this repository I keep all my configurations and dot files to maintain my healthy development environment for any case. It contains configurations
for shell and environments like zsh (arch-linux, macos), powershell (windows). It comes with installer to shorten my time spending on set up.

> Everytime I installed my dev env manually by myself, I started feeling like a garbage myself... So here you are!

## Features

- Syntax Highlighting
- Auto Completions
- Auto Suggestions
- Rust made replacements
- Key configurations
- Software configurations

## Install (Automatic)

This process can be tough and easy at the same time depending on yourself... If you prefer trusting me and let me do all the dirty stuff, then just run the install script located on the root location of the project like this:

```shell
# I'm not evil, check the source code if you don't trust me!
sudo ./install.sh && echo "Yay, I'm done installing dot files!"
```

## Install (Manual)

WIP blyat. Stay tuned!
